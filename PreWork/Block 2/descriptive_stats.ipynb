This indicates that the statistical measure **mean is sensitive to extreme values or outliers**, while the **median and mode are more resistant to such values**. Therefore, when analyzing data that may contain outliers, it is advisable to rely on the median and mode rather than the mean.

The majority of passengers (491 or 55.11%) were in the third class, followed by 216 (24.24%) in the first class and 184 (20.65%) in the second class.

The majority of passengers (644 or 72.28%) boarded from Southampton, followed by 168 (18.86%) from Cherbourg and 77 (8.64%) from Queenstown.
