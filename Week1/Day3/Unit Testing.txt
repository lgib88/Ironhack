he assert statement adds controls for debugging a program. It allows us to express a condition that must always be true, and that, if not, will interrupt the program, generating an exception to handle called AssertionError.

#AssertionError: 250 != 300

assert #MAKE SURE THIS IS THIS

assert 10 == 10, "sdsd"

assert 10 == 11, "Not equal"
