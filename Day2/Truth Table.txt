Relational operators

Relational operators are symbols used to compare two values ​​or expressions. The result of the evaluation with these two operators can be True, if the comparison is true, or False, if the comparison is false.

== Equal to a == b
!= Not equal to a != b
> Greater than a > b
< Lesser than a < b
>= Greater than or equal to a >= b
<= Less than or equal to a <= b

Note the difference between a single equals sign (=), which is an assignment, and a double equals sign (==), which is a relational operator
